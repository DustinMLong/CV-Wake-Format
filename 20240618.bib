The intervention was 12 HIV and sexual health videos tailored to FSWs that were released over 8 weeks through a secret Facebook group platform. In- person surveys were administered before, after the intervention, and three months later. No HIV seroconversions were detected; all participants completed follow-up and agreed to recommend the intervention to a coworker. Although the intervention was assessed to be acceptable and feasible to implement, poor internet connectivity was a key barrier. In time-series analysis, the intervention group participants reported improved PrEP interest, PrEP knowledge, and condom use along with reduced PrEP and HIV-related stigma, but no impact on sex-work related stigma or social cohesion. Similar results occurred in the control group. Cross- contamination and small pilot study size might have hindered the ability to detect the differential impact of this intervention. As communications technology increases in Cameroon, it is essential to learn more about FSWs preferences on the use of social media platforms for HIV prevention strategies.},

	abstract = {INTRODUCTION: The aetiology of bacterial vaginosis (BV), a biofilm- associated vaginal infection, remains unknown. Epidemiologic data suggest that it is sexually transmitted. BV is characterised by loss of lactic acid-producing lactobacilli and an increase in facultative and strict anaerobic bacteria. Gardnerella spp are present in 95\%-100\% of cases; Gardnerella vaginalis has been found to be more virulent than other BV- associated bacteria (BVAB) in vitro. However, G. vaginalis is found in women with normal vaginal microbiota and colonisation is not sufficient for BV development. We hypothesise that Gardnerella spp initiate BV biofilm formation, but incident BV (iBV) requires incorporation of other key BVAB (ie, Prevotella bivia, Fannyhessea vaginae) into the biofilm that alter the transcriptome of the polymicrobial consortium. This study will investigate the sequence of microbiologic events preceding iBV. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: This study will enrol 150 women aged 18-45 years with normal vaginal microbiota and no sexually transmitted infections at a sexual health research clinic in Birmingham, Alabama. Women will self- collect twice daily vaginal specimens up to 60 days. A combination of 16S rRNA gene sequencing, qPCR for Gardnerella spp, P. bivia and F. vaginae, and broad range 16S rRNA gene qPCR will be performed on twice daily vaginal specimens from women with iBV (Nugent score 7-10 on at least 2 consecutive days) and controls (with comparable age, race, contraceptive method and menstrual cycle days) maintaining normal vaginal microbiota to investigate changes in the vaginal microbiota over time for women with iBV. Participants will complete daily diaries on multiple factors including sexual activity. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: This protocol is approved by the University of Alabama at Birmingham Institutional Review Board (IRB-300004547) and written informed consent will be obtained from all participants. Findings will be presented at scientific conferences and published in peer-reviewed journals as well as disseminated to providers and patients in communities of interest.},

In this exploratory study, we examine the relationship between HIV viral suppression, STI testing, and STI diagnosis among YWH receiving care at a clinic in the southern United States.Methods: Data from 933 clinical visits (2017-2020) were aggregated into singular patient records for YWH aged 10-24 years in Alabama (N = 139). Analyses included univariate generalized linear mixed models performed with the PROC GLIMMIX procedure approximating the marginal likelihood by using Laplace's method.Results: Sample median age was 22 years at the index visit. Most YWH were 20-24 years old (69.1\%), male (67.6\%), and identified as Black (77\%); 58.3\% were virally unsuppressed at index visit. YWH who identified as White or of other races had 4.79 times higher odds of being virally suppressed as compared to Black YWH (p {\textless} .01); STI testing behavior and STI positive diagnosis were associated with lower odds of being virally suppression.Conclusions: Findings suggest that among YWH, receiving STI testing and having an STI diagnosis is associated with a lack of viral suppression, suggesting that extra efforts may be necessary to support YWH who have an STI to attain suppression. Research is needed to examine individual behaviors, structural forces, and clinic features that could impact STI care engagement, specifically among unsuppressed YWH.},

	abstract = {Mediation analysis has become increasingly popular over the last decade as researchers are interested in assessing mechanistic pathways for intervention. Although available methods have increased, there are still limited options for mediation analysis with zero-inflated count variables where the distribution of response has a "cluster" of data at the zero value (i.e. distribution of number of cigarettes smoked per day, where nonsmokers cluster at zero cigarettes). The currently available methods do not obtain unbiased population average effects of mediation effects. In this paper, we propose an extension of the counterfactual approach to mediation with direct and indirect effects to scenarios where the mediator is a count variable with excess zeroes by utilizing the Marginalized Zero-Inflated Poisson Model (MZIP) for the mediator model. We derive direct and indirect effects for continuous, binary, and count outcomes, as well as adapt to allow mediator-exposure interactions. Our proposed work allows straightforward calculation of direct and indirect effects for the overall population mean values of the mediator, for scenarios in which researchers are interested in generalizing direct and indirect effects to the population. We apply this novel methodology to an application observing how alcohol consumption may explain sex differences in cholesterol and assess model performance via a simulation study comparing the proposed MZIP mediator framework to existing methods for marginal mediator effects.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVES: People with HIV (PWH) are aging and are experiencing higher rates of abdominal adiposity. Physical activity is an effective nonpharmacological strategy to reduce adiposity in the general aging population. Yet, the relationship between physical activity and adiposity in people with well controlled HIV is unclear. Our objective was to describe the association between objectively-measured physical activity and abdominal adiposity in PWH. METHODS: As part of the multisite, observational PROSPER-HIV study, virologically suppressed, adult PWH wore an Actigraph accelerometer for 7-10 days and completed duplicate waist and hip circumference measures. Demographic and medical characteristics were abstracted from the CFAR Network of Integrated Clinical Systems dataset. Descriptive statistics and multiple linear regressions were used to analyze the data. RESULTS: On average, our 419 PWH were 58 years of age [interquartile range (IQR): 50, 64], male (77\%), Black (54\%), and currently taking an integrase inhibitor (78\%). PWH completed a mean of 7.06 (+/-2.74) days of total actigraphy wear time. They took an average of 4905 (3233, 7140) steps per day and engaged in 5.4 h of sedentary time per day. Controlling for age, sex, employment and integrase inhibitor use, the number of steps taken per day was associated with reduced abdominal adiposity ( F = 3.27; P {\textless} 0.001) and the hours of daily sedentary time was associated with increased abdominal adiposity ( F = 3.24; P {\textless} 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Greater physical activity is associated with reduced abdominal adiposity in aging PWH. Future work should investigate how to tailor the amount, type and intensity of physical activity needed to reduce adiposity in PWH taking contemporary HIV medication.

SETTING: Study participants were or had participated in health sciences pathway programs at Birmingham City Schools and/or the University of Alabama at Birmingham. METHODS: We took a concurrent mixed methods approach to conduct an environmental scan of health science pathway programs in the Birmingham, AL area. Four focus groups were conducted between November 2022 and January 2023, and a 225-item online survey was administered between November 4, 2022, and February 4, 2023. Both tools collected data from high school, undergraduate, and graduate students to examine key components of existing health care pathways programs for URMs and identify barriers and facilitators to successful implementation of such programs. RESULTS: Twenty-two students participated in the focus groups, and 168 individuals responded to the survey. Both focus group participants and interview respondents were primarily URMs (eg, 68.2\% and 65.7\% identified as Black or African American, respectively). Survey responses and focus group discussions showed that, overall, undergraduate and graduate students programs develop more robust identities as future health care professionals through friendships and institutional supports, expand their networks more broadly through mentorship, and feel more supported by family members in their academic endeavors than high school students. CONCLUSIONS: Health science pathway programs for URMs should facilitate and bolster social supports for students, especially those in high school, to enhance persistence through education and into the workforce.},

This study evaluated all scheduled HIV primary care provider visits for two years following diagnosis date. A kept-visit measure was calculated such that, if an individual attended {\textgreater}/=1 visit in each of the four 6-month intervals, they were considered to have high visit constancy. A missed-visit measure was categorized as {\textgreater}/=1 no-show vs. 0 no-show for first and second year after diagnosis. Odds ratios (OR) and 95\% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated using logistic regression models. Models were adjusted for confounding sociodemographic and clinical characteristics. The study population was 76\% Black, 57\% male, median age of 37 years. Overall, 65\% had high visit consistency and 34.5\% had {\textgreater}/=1 no-show in both years. Compared to unpartnered, married individuals had higher visit constancy [AOR (95\% CI): 2.88 (1.02, 8.16)]; no differences were observed among unmarried-partnered individuals. No differences in having {\textgreater}/=1 no-show among partnership status groups were observed for either year.

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: The syndemic of mental health (MH) and substance use disorders (SUDs) is common among persons living with HIV and jeopardizes HIV treatment adherence, engagement in care, and viral load suppression. Electronic patient-reported outcomes (ePROs), completed through tablet or computer, and telemedicine are evidence- and technology-based interventions that have been used to successfully increase screening and treatment, respectively, a model that holds promise for persons living with HIV. To date, there is limited guidance on implementing ePROs and telemedicine into HIV clinical practice even though it is well known that these evidence-based tools improve diagnosis and access to care. OBJECTIVE: To address this, we aim to conduct a multicomponent intervention for persons living with HIV, including the delivery of HIV services and telemedicine through effective ePROs (+STEP), to increase screening and treatment of MH and SUD in Ryan White HIV/AIDS Program (RWHAP)-funded clinics in Alabama. METHODS: Through this intervention, we will conduct a readiness, acceptability, and accessibility assessment and implement +STEP to improve the diagnosis and treatment of MH and SUD at RWHAP clinics in Alabama. To describe implementation strategies that address barriers to the uptake of +STEP in RWHAP clinics, we will conduct qualitative interviews in years 1 (early implementation), 2 (scale up), and 4 (maintenance) with patients and key staff to evaluate barriers, facilitators, and implementation strategies. Our Results will enable us to modify strategies to enhance +STEP penetration over time and inform the implementation blueprint, which we will develop for both RWHAP clinics in Alabama and future sites. We will assess the impact of implementing +STEP on diagnoses, referrals, and health care use related to MH, SUD, and HIV by comparing clinical outcomes from patients receiving these interventions (ePROs and telemedicine) with historical controls. RESULTS: The first study site began implementation in April 2022. A total of 2 additional sites have initiated ePROs. Final results are expected in 2026. The results of this study will provide a foundation for future research expanding access to ePROs for improved diagnosis linked to telemedicine access to accelerate patients along the continuum of care from MH and SUD diagnosis to treatment. CONCLUSIONS: Achieving the end of the HIV epidemic in the United States necessitates programs that accelerate movement across the MH and SUD care continuum from diagnosis to treatment for persons living with HIV. Scaling these services represents a path toward improved treatment outcomes with both individual health and population-level prevention benefits of sustained HIV viral suppression in the era of undetectable=untransmittable (U=U). This study will address this evidence gap through the evaluation of the implementation of +STEP to establish the necessary systems and processes to screen, identify, and better treat substance use and MH for people living with HIV.

This study compared HIV- related no-shows by visit type (in-person; video; telephone) during the COVID-19 pandemic (April 2020-September 2021) from the Data for Care Alabama project. Using all primary care provider visits, each visit's outcome was categorized as no-show or arrived. A logistic regression model using generalized estimating equations accounting for repeat measures in individuals and within sites calculated odds ratios (OR) and their accompanying 95\% confidence interval (CI) for no-shows by visit modality. The multivariable models adjusted for sociodemographic factors. In-person versus telephone visits [OR (95\% CI) 1.64 (1.48-1.82)] and in- person versus video visits [OR (95\% CI) 1.53 (1.25-1.85)] had higher odds of being a no-show. In-person versus telephone and video no-shows were significantly higher. This may suggest success of telehealth visits as a method for HIV care delivery even beyond COVID-19.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Achieving early and sustained viral suppression (VS) following diagnosis of HIV infection is critical to improving outcomes for persons with HIV (PWH). The Deep South of the United States (US) is a region that is disproportionately impacted by the domestic HIV epidemic. Time to VS, defined as time from diagnosis to initial VS, is substantially longer in the South than other regions of the US. We describe the development and implementation of a distributed data network between an academic institution and state health departments to investigate variation in time to VS in the Deep South. METHODS: Representatives of state health departments, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), and the academic partner met to establish core objectives and procedures at the beginning of the project. Importantly, this project used the CDC-developed Enhanced HIV/AIDS Reporting System (eHARS) through a distributed data network model that maintained the confidentiality and integrity of the data. Software programs to build datasets and calculate time to VS were written by the academic partner and shared with each public health partner. To develop spatial elements of the eHARS data, health departments geocoded residential addresses of each newly diagnosed individual in eHARS between 2012-2019, supported by the academic partner. Health departments conducted all analyses within their own systems. Aggregate results were combined across states using meta-analysis techniques. Additionally, we created a synthetic eHARS data set for code development and testing. RESULTS: The collaborative structure and distributed data network have allowed us to refine the study questions and analytic plans to conduct investigations into variation in time to VS for both research and public health practice. Additionally, a synthetic eHARS data set has been created and is publicly available for researchers and public health practitioners. CONCLUSIONS: These efforts have leveraged the practice expertise and surveillance data within state health departments and the analytic and methodologic expertise of the academic partner. This study could serve as an illustrative example of effective collaboration between academic institutions and public health agencies and provides resources to facilitate future use of the US HIV surveillance system for research and public health practice.},

Methods: We employed the collection of the PRAPARE tool in the EMR of a large academic health system in the ambulatory clinic and emergency department setting. After integration, we evaluated SDoH prevalence, levels of missingness, and data anomalies to inform ongoing collection. We summarized responses using descriptive statistics and hand-reviewed data text fields and patterns in the data. Data on patients who were administered with the PRAPARE from February to December 2020 were extracted from the EMR. Patients missing {\textgreater}/= 12 PRAPARE questions were excluded. Social risks were screened using the PRAPARE. Information on demographics, admittance status, and health coverage were extracted from the EMR. Results: Assessments with N = 6531 were completed (mean age 54 years, female (58.6\%), 43.8\% Black). Missingness ranged from 0.4\% (race) to 20.8\% (income). Approximately 6\% of patients were homeless; 8\% reported housing insecurity; 1.4\% reported food needs; 14.6\% had healthcare needs; 8.4\% needed utility assistance; and 5\% lacked transportation related to medical care. Emergency department patients reported significantly higher proportions of suboptimal SDoH. Conclusions: Integrating the PRAPARE assessment in the EMR provides valuable information on SDoH amenable to intervention, and strategies are needed to increase accurate data collection and to improve the use of data in the clinical encounter.},

This prospective study aims to investigate changes in the composition of the vaginal microbiota over time in TGM who retain their natal genitalia (ie, vagina) and initiate T. In addition, we will identify changes in the vaginal microbiota preceding incident BV (iBV) in this cohort while investigating behavioural factors, along with hormonal shifts, which may be associated with iBV. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: T-naive TGM who have not undergone gender-affirming genital surgery with normal baseline vaginal microbiota (ie, no Amsel criteria, normal Nugent Score with no Gardnerella vaginalis morphotypes) will self-collect daily vaginal specimens for 7 days prior to initiating T and for 90 days thereafter. These specimens will be used for vaginal Gram stain, 16S rRNA gene sequencing and shotgun metagenomic sequencing to characterise shifts in the vaginal microbiota over time, including development of iBV. Participants will complete daily diaries on douching, menses and behavioural factors including sexual activity during the study.

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) is a highly effective biomedical prevention intervention and a major strategy for reducing the HIV burden in the United States. However, PrEP provision and uptake remain lower than estimated needs, and in ways that may exacerbate HIV disparities among Black adolescent girls and young women in the southern United States. Data suggest that gaps in provider knowledge of HIV epidemiology and PrEP and skills assessing sexual health practices are important barriers to provision and uptake, with limited evidence-based interventions to address these gaps. OBJECTIVE: This paper describes the "PrEP-Pro" intervention, a multicomponent intervention to train and support family medicine (FM) trainees to promote PrEP for adolescent girls and young women in Alabama. METHODS: The PrEP-Pro intervention comprises 3 main components guided by the Capability-Opportunity- Motivation-Behavior (COM-B) model for behavioral change and the Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research (CFIR): (1) provider HIV epidemiology and PrEP education, (2) sexual history taking, and (3) PrEP Champions. In phase 1, we will work with community advisory boards (providers and clients) and then conduct focus groups with FM trainees to adapt content to train FM residents on HIV epidemiology and PrEP and develop implementation strategies, including provider-facing tools and client-facing educational materials. In phase 2, we will pretest and then pilot-test the initially adapted PrEP-Pro intervention with FM trainees. FM trainees will complete baseline, 3-, and 6-month questionnaires post PrEP-Pro intervention. We will also conduct in-depth interviews (IDIs) with FM pilot participants, adolescent girls and young women who accessed care after the PrEP-Pro pilot, and key stakeholders. The primary outcomes are PrEP-Pro acceptability and feasibility, which would be assessed using validated instruments at months 3 (among pretest participants) and 6 (among pilot participants). Secondary outcomes will also be assessed, including PrEP knowledge, sexual history-taking attitudes and practices, PrEP prescriptions among adolescent girls and young women encounters, and sexually transmitted infections (STIs) and HIV testing among adolescent girls and young women encounters in 6 months. RESULTS: Study results will be disseminated to practices, state health officials, and other key stakeholders to solicit feedback on implementation opportunities and challenges to inform a hybrid effectiveness implementation trial. Our results will also be presented at local and national conferences and submitted to peer-reviewed journals. CONCLUSIONS: As PrEP grows, there is a pressing need to train FM providers and develop appropriate, contextually relevant tools to support PrEP implementation. The PrEP-Pro intervention is a multicomponent intervention to train FM residents across Alabama on sexual history-taking, PrEP provision for adolescent girls and young women, and supporting practice-based PrEP Champions. The PrEP-Pro intervention is anticipated to increase PrEP prescriptions for adolescent girls and young women and expand comprehensive sexual and reproductive health care for adolescent girls and young women in rural and urban Alabama.

Novel strategies to inform testing outreach in rural states with dispersed HIV epidemics are needed. Methods: Alabama state public health HIV testing surveillance data from 2013 to 2017 were used to estimate time from infection to HIV diagnosis using CD4 T-cell depletion modeling, mapped to county. Diagnostic HIV tests performed during 2013-2021 by commercial testing entities were used to estimate HIV tests per 100 000 adults (aged 15-65 years), mapped to client ZIP Code Tabulation Area (ZCTA). We then defined testing "cold spots": those with {\textless}10\% adults tested plus either (1) within or bordering 1 of the 13 counties with HIV prevalence {\textgreater}400 cases per 100 000 population or (2) within a county with average time to diagnosis greater than the state average to inform testing outreach. Results: Time to HIV diagnosis was a median of 3.7 (interquartile range [IQR], 0-9.2) years across Alabama, with a range of 0.06-12.25 years. Approximately 63\% of counties (n = 42) had a longer time to diagnosis compared to national US estimates. Six hundred forty-three ZCTAs tested 17.3\% (IQR, 10.3\%-25.0\%) of the adult population from 2013 to 2017. To prioritize areas for testing outreach, we generated maps to describe 47 areas of HIV-testing cold spots at the ZCTA level. Conclusions: Combining public health surveillance with commercial testing data provides a more nuanced understanding of HIV testing gaps in a state with a rural HIV epidemic and identifies areas to prioritize for testing outreach.},

	abstract = {Background: The U.S. Southeast has a high burden of SARS-CoV-2 infections and COVID-19 disease. We used public data sources and community engagement to prioritize county selections for a precision population health intervention to promote a SARS-CoV-2 testing intervention in rural Alabama during October 2020 and March 2021. Methods: We modeled factors associated with county-level SARS-CoV-2 percent positivity using covariates thought to associate with SARS-CoV-2 acquisition risk, disease severity, and risk mitigation practices. Descriptive epidemiologic data were presented to scientific and community advisory boards to prioritize counties for a testing intervention. Results: In October 2020, SARS-CoV-2 percent positivity was not associated with any modeled factors. In March 2021, premature death rate (aRR 1.16, 95\% CI 1.07, 1.25), percent Black residents (aRR 1.00, 95\% CI 1.00, 1.01), preventable hospitalizations (aRR 1.03, 95\% CI 1.00, 1.06), and proportion of smokers (aRR 0.231, 95\% CI 0.10, 0.55) were associated with average SARS-CoV-2 percent positivity. We then ranked counties based on percent positivity, case fatality, case rates, and number of testing sites using individual variables and factor scores. Top ranking counties identified through factor analysis and univariate associations were provided to community partners who considered ongoing efforts and strength of community partnerships to promote testing to inform intervention. Conclusions: The dynamic nature of SARS-CoV-2 proved challenging for a modelling approach to inform a precision population health intervention at the county level. Epidemiological data allowed for engagement of community stakeholders implementing testing. As data sources and analytic capacities expand, engaging communities in data interpretation is vital to address diseases locally.},

Thus, the objective of this study is to examine STI testing behavior and outcomes among a sample of YLHIV in the southern United States. Clinical records of 139 YLHIV who received HIV care in Alabama (2017-2020) were evaluated for receipt of STI testing (gonorrhea, chlamydia, syphilis), prevalence of positive test results, and factors associated with testing outcomes (933 clinical visits). RESULTS: Nearly 80\% of our sample identified as African American, most were 20-24 years, and about 60\% reported detectable viral load at first visit during the study period. Just under 60\% of cisgender male and transgender female clients reported receipt of at least one STI test, compared to less than 40\% of cisgender females. Identifying as a cisgender male and having been diagnosed with HIV related to sex with men were associated with greater likelihood receiving STI testing. Cisgender males reported higher rates of positive syphilis test results than cisgender females; the highest rates of positive STI tests were among transgender females. Results underscore need for providers to promote routine STI testing to YLHIV.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To examine type 2 diabetes mellitus incidence and associated risk factors among people with HIV (PWH). DESIGN: A retrospective clinical cohort study of PWH at a Southeastern US academic HIV clinic between 2008 and 2018. METHODS: PWH who attended at least two clinic visits were evaluated with demographic and clinical data extracted from the electronic medical record (EMR). Diabetes was defined as: hemoglobin A1C {\textgreater}/=6.5\% and/or 2 glucose results {\textgreater}200 mg/dl (at least 30 days apart), diagnosis of diabetes in the EMR, or exposure to diabetes medication. Time to diabetes incidence was computed from the entire clinic population for each year. Multivariable Cox proportional hazard regression models with time-dependent covariates were created to evaluate the independent association between covariates and time to incident diabetes. RESULTS: Among 4113 PWH, we identified 252 incident cases of diabetes. Incidence increased from 1.04 incidents per 1000 person years (PY) in 2008, to 1.55 incidents per 1000 PY in 2018. Body mass index (hazard ratio [HR] 10.5 (6.2, 17.7)), liver disease (HR 1.9 (1.2, 3.1)), steroid exposure (HR 1.5 (1.1, 1.9)), and use of integrase inhibitors (HR 1.5 (1.1, 2.0)) were associated with incident diabetes. Additional associated factors included lower CD4 + cell counts, duration of HIV infection, exposure to nonstatin lipid-lowering therapy, and dyslipidemia. CONCLUSIONS: Rapidly increasing incident diabetes rates among PWH were associated with both traditional and HIV-related associated risk factors, particularly body weight, steroid exposure, and use of Integrase Inhibitors. Notably, several of the risk factors identified are modifiable and can be targeted for intervention.},

FRESH is a healthcare setting stigma-reduction intervention designed to reduce stigmas affecting people living with HIV (PLHIV), focusing on HIV and intersectional stigmas experienced by sexual and gender minority (SGM) people living with HIV. After the successful adaptation of the FRESH intervention, it will be pilot-tested through the conduct of a pilot stepped wedge cluster randomized controlled trial. Methods: Three aims are included in this study; Aim 1 includes exploratory qualitative assessment, specifically the conduct four focus groups with men who have sex with men (MSM) living with HIV (n = 24-32) and in-depth interviews with transgender women living with HIV to explore their experiences with stigma in clinics (n = 9-12). In-depth interviews will also be held with HIV healthcare workers to elucidate their perceptions and behaviors towards their SGM clients (n = 9-12). In Aim 2, informed by Aim 1 data, we will use the sequential phases of the ADAPT- ITT framework to iteratively adapt the FRESH intervention for the Dominican Republic. In Aim 3, the adapted intervention will be pilot- tested via a cluster stepped wedge randomized controlled trial to assess feasibility and acceptability of the intervention and study protocols. Conclusions: If this pilot trial is successful, next steps will include testing the adapted intervention across Dominican Republic or in similar Spanish-speaking Caribbean nations in a larger trial to assess effectiveness in reducing stigma in clinical settings towards PLHIV.},

METHODS: Using a sample representative of the US adult population with regard to sex, age, and ethnicity (N = 2822), this study examined the prevalence and potential risk factors of classic psychedelic-related seizures, in a subsample of respondents who reported lifetime classic psychedelic use (n = 613). RESULTS: Among those who reported lifetime classic psychedelic use, 1.5 \% reported classic psychedelic-related seizures, a statistic that comports with the prevalence of epilepsy in the US population. Among those who reported seizures while using a classic psychedelic, almost half reported co-use of antidepressants, mood stabilizers, or opioid replacement therapies at the time of the seizures. Notably, classic psychedelic-related seizures were more commonly reported in certain respondents, especially those with a personal or family history of epilepsy. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that classic psychedelic use could increase the risk of seizures in certain populations, particularly those with a personal or family history of epilepsy.},

This study aims to investigate this association among WLWH and women at risk for HIV (WRH) in the United States. METHODS AND RESULTS: Data from 351 WLWH and 52 WRH participants from the Women's Interagency HIV Study having pocket depths and clinical periodontal attachment loss assessments in 2003-2004 were included. Multinomial logistic regression analyses in the full sample assessed the relationship between BMI (underweight/normal, overweight, or obese) and periodontitis by severity (mild, moderate, severe), adjusting for study sites, age, education, annual household income, smoking, alcohol consumption, and diabetes. Overall, 75.2\% women (76.0\% WLWH; 69.0\% WRH) had periodontitis. Moreover, 75.0\% obese and 75.3\% overweight women were affected by periodontitis. In the full sample, adjusted odds ratio (aOR) of having mild, moderate, and severe periodontitis in obese women were: 1.14 (95\% confidence interval [CI]: 0.51-2.52), 1.02 (95\% CI: 0.46-2.29), and 0.24 (95\% CI: 0.06-1.07), respectively, and in overweight women: 0.70 (95\% CI: 0.31-1.58), 0.85 (95\% CI: 0.38-1.90), and 0.31 (95\% CI: 0.08-1.15), respectively.

	abstract = {Hypertension (HTN) is a common comorbidity among people with HIV and associated with an increased risk for atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease and chronic kidney disease. The relationship of antiretroviral therapy (ART) initiation to incident HTN remains a clinical question. We determined HTN incidence at 48 weeks of follow-up among ART-naive participants without HTN and not taking antihypertensive medications at ART initiation through randomized clinical trials through the AIDS Clinical Trial Group between 1999 and 2011. We assessed the association of baseline characteristics, including randomized ART agents with HTN incidence at 48 weeks using Poisson regression models. Incident HTN was defined as blood pressure {\textgreater}/=130/80 mmHg, or use of antihypertensive medication. Among 2,614 participants, mean age was 37 +/- 10 years, 79\% male sex, and 36\% African American race. After 48 weeks, 839 participants (32\%) developed HTN. Receiving a non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI) was associated with an increased relative risk (RR) of incident HTN, while the risk was lower for protease inhibitor use. Stavudine and efavirenz were associated with an increased RR of developing HTN, while tenofovir disoproxil fumarate, darunavir/ritonavir, and atazanavir/ritonavir were associated with a decreased risk of developing HTN. Additionally, older age, higher body mass index (BMI), and having hepatitis C were associated with an increased risk for developing HTN, while women and participants with a higher baseline CD4 count were at a decreased risk of developing HTN at 48 weeks. One third of these ART naive participants developed HTN after ART initiation. NNRTIs, notably efavirenz, and stavudine were associated with an increased risk of HTN. Additional factors associated with HTN included traditional factors like older age and higher BMI, and advanced HIV disease (lower CD4 count). (Clinicaltrials.gov: NCT00001137).},

We implemented a microbiology question bank smart phone app enhanced with game elements and clinical pearls during a microbiology course for first- year medical students. We hypothesized that these enhancements and clinical pearls would engage the students meaningfully and increase their knowledge base. Methods: Though use was optional, students' game play was recorded through the app, which was compared to test grades retrospectively. A player efficiency rating (PER) was calculated as a function of question response, accuracy, and engagement. Students were separated into tertiles of PER and median exam grades were compared using a non-parametric Kruskal-Wallis (KW) test. An anonymous satisfaction and usability feedback survey was also administered. Results: One hundred eighty-one of the 189 students (96\%) answered at least one question, and 165 (87\%) completed all 56 questions. The average PER was 84.75. We received feedback surveys from 61 (34\%) students in the course, with positive responses regarding the perceived impact on learning microbiology. The KW test found a positive correlation for median exam scores of the player groups when divided into tertiles by PER (p = 0.0002). Conclusions: We leveraged gamification and clinical pearls to design a supplemental microbiology question bank. We found high engagement overall and higher class exam scores associated with greater use of the question bank.},

The current study examines this association in relation to a variety of chronic illnesses and also considers possible related parental and adolescent background factors. METHODS: Secondary analyses used longitudinal data from the University of North Carolina National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent to Adult Health. Interviews were used to assess demographics, adolescent somatic symptoms, living situation, and parental illness and general physical health. Somatic symptoms in adolescents with no ill parents (n = 2302 adolescents; Mage = 15.3) were compared with adolescents with ill mothers (n = 2336; Mage = 15.3), ill fathers (n = 1304; Mage = 15.3), or two ill parents (n = 3768; Mage = 15.3) using Poisson regression models. We also examined the role of living status, adolescent sex, and parent general physical health on somatic symptom outcomes. RESULTS: Elevated somatic symptoms were observed in adolescents with ill mothers (mean ratio [MR] = 1.15, p = .015) and with both parents ill (MR = 1.10, p {\textless} .001). Among adolescents with ill parents, females had more symptoms than males (ill mother: MR = 1.12, p {\textless} .001; ill father: MR = 1.23, p {\textless} .001; and both parents ill: MR = 1.23, p {\textless} .001). Poorer maternal physical health also increased somatic symptom risk (MR = 1.12, p = .02). Longitudinally, adolescents with ill mothers (MR = 1.14, p {\textless} .001), ill fathers (MR = 1.13, p {\textless} .001), or both parents ill (MR = 1.16, p {\textless} .001) had increased somatic symptom risk. Wave I somatic symptoms also increased future risk: ill mother (MR = 1.19, p {\textless} .001), ill father (MR = 1.22, p {\textless} .001), or both parents ill (MR = 1.20, p {\textless} .001). CONCLUSIONS: The results highlight that having an ill parent is a risk factor for adolescent somatic symptoms. In addition, other factors such as adolescent sex play an additional role in adolescent somatic symptoms.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: African American youth in rural Alabama are clinically underserved and have limited knowledge about the human papillomavirus and the novel coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) vaccines, including knowledge about the risk for developing cervical or oropharyngeal cancers or COVID-19. OBJECTIVE: In this 30-month study, we propose to develop an in-clinic, youth-tailored, vaccine-promoting intervention for vaccine hesitancy reduction that can be seamlessly integrated into the existing environments of pediatric and family practice settings in rural Alabama. METHODS: This exploratory, sequential mixed methods study will be conducted in 3 phases. In the first phase, we will assess stakeholders' knowledge, sentiments, and beliefs related to vaccination in general, COVID-19 vaccination, and human papillomavirus vaccination. We will also assess stakeholders' perceptions of barriers to vaccination that exist in rural Alabama. This will be followed by a second phase wherein we will use the data collected in the first phase to inform the development and finalization of a noninvasive, modular, synchronous counseling intervention that targets the behaviors of 15- to 26-year-old adolescents. In the third phase, we will conduct a pilot hybrid type 1 effectiveness-implementation cluster-randomized controlled trial to assess intervention acceptability and feasibility (clinics: N=4; African American youth: N=120) while assessing a "clinical signal" of effectiveness. We will document implementation contexts to provide real- world insight and support dissemination and scale-up. RESULTS: The study was funded at the end of December 2020. Approval from the University of Alabama at Birmingham Institutional Review Board was obtained in May 2021, and the qualitative data collection process outlined in the first phase of this project concluded in November 2021. The entire study is expected to be complete at the end of December 2023. CONCLUSIONS: The results of the trial will provide much needed information on vaccine hesitancy in rural Alabama, and if found efficacious, the intervention could notably increase rates of vaccinations in one of the most underserved parts of the United States. The results from the trial will provide information that is valuable to public health practitioners and providers in rural settings to inform their efforts in increasing vaccination rates among 15- to 26-year-old African American youth in rural southern United States.

	abstract = {Introduction: As a local response to the COVID-19 global pandemic, the University of Alabama at Birmingham (UAB) established the UAB COVID-19 Collaborative Outcomes Research Enterprise (CORE), an institutional learning health system (LHS) to achieve an integrated health services outcomes and research response. Methods: We developed a network of expertise and capabilities to rapidly develop and deploy an institutional-level interdisciplinary LHS. Based upon a scoping review of the literature and the Knowledge to Action Framework, we adopted a LHS framework identifying contributors and components necessary to developing a system within and between the university academic and medical centers. We used social network analysis to examine the emergence of informal work patterns and diversified network capabilities based on the LHS framework. Results: This experience report details three principal characteristics of the UAB COVID-19 CORE LHS development: (a) identifying network contributors and components; (b) building the institutional network; and (c) diversifying network capabilities. Contributors and committees were identified from seven components of LHS: (a) collaborative and executive leadership committee, (b) research coordinating committee, (c) oversight and ethics committee, (d) thematic scientific working groups, (e) programmatic working groups, (f) informatics capabilities, and (g) patient advisory groups. Evolving from the topical interests of the initial CORE participants, scientific working groups emerged to support the learning system network. Programmatic working groups were charged with developing a comprehensive and mutually accessible COVID-19 database. Discussion: Our LHS framework allowed for effective integration of multiple academic and medical centers into a cohesive institutional- level learning system. Network analysis indicated diversity of institutional disciplines, professional rank, and topical focus pertaining to COVID-19, with each center leveraging existing institutional responsibilities to minimize gaps in network capabilities. Conclusion: Incorporating an adapted LHS framework designed for academic medical centers served as a foundational resource supporting further institutional-level efforts to develop agile and responsive learning networks.},

We used marginal structural models to compare time to first self-reported gonorrhea, chlamydia, or trichomonas infection for nonincarcerated women and incarcerated women. Covariates included demographic factors, HIV status, sex exchange, drug/alcohol use, and prior incarceration. Results: Three thousand hundred twenty-four women contributed a median of 4 at-risk years and experienced 213 first incident STI events. The crude incidence of STIs was 3.7 per 100 person- years for incarcerated women and 1.9 per 100 person-years for nonincarcerated women. The weighted hazard ratio for incident STIs was 4.05 (95\% confidence interval: 1.61-10.19).

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Previous studies examining the role of partnership on HIV care outcomes have primarily focused on the men who have sex with men population in the United States, leaving a gap in the literature on this phenomenon among the heterosexual persons with HIV (PWH). This study examined association between partnership around diagnosis (married, unmarried-partnered, and un-partnered) with time to viral suppression (TVS) and sustained viral suppression (SVS) in newly diagnosed heterosexual PWH from a HIV clinic in Birmingham, Alabama. METHODS: TVS [time to first viral load (VL) {\textless}200 copies/ml] was measured using VLs from 12 months following diagnosis using Kaplan-Meier and proportional hazard model for interval censoring (n=153) to calculate hazard ratios (HRs) and 95\% confidence intervals (CIs). SVS was measured using VLs for 12 months after first VS using logistic regression model (n=137) to calculate odds ratios (ORs) and 95\% CIs. Models were adjusted for confounding demographics and clinical characteristics. RESULTS: The study population comprised of 77\% Black, 57\% male, and 46\% aged 31-49 years; 24\% were married, 35\% unmarried-partnered, and 41\% un-partnered. The median TVS (days) was 57 for married, 73 for unmarried-partnered, and 75 for un-partnered. Compared to un-partnered individuals, unmarried- partnered had similar, whereas married had 69\% higher [HR (95\% CI): 1.69 (1.02, 2.78)] hazard of TVS. Compared to un-partnered, unmarried- partnered and married individuals had similar odds of achieving SVS. CONCLUSION: Married, newly diagnosed, heterosexual PWH had faster TVS than un-partnered individuals suggesting that intimate partners may help achieve HIV care goals.},

MR methods applicable to the general exponential family of distributions are currently not well characterized. We adapt a general linear model framework to the IV setting and propose a general MR method applicable to any full-rank distribution from the exponential family. Empirical bias and coverage are estimated via simulations. The proposed method is compared to several existing MR methods. Real data analyses are performed using data from the REGARDS study to estimate the potential causal effect of smoking frequency on stroke risk in African Americans. In simulations with binary variates and very weak instruments the proposed method had the lowest median [Q1 , Q3 ] bias (0.10 [-3.68 to 3.62]); compared with 2SPS (0.27 [-3.74 to 4.26]) and the Wald method (-0.69 [-1.72 to 0.35]). Low bias was observed throughout other simulation scenarios; as well as more than 90\% coverage for the proposed method. In simulations with count variates, the proposed method performed comparably to 2SPS; the Wald method maintained the most consistent low bias; and 2SRI was biased towards the null. Real data analyses find no evidence for a causal effect of smoking frequency on stroke risk. The proposed MR method has low bias and acceptable coverage across a wide range of distributional scenarios and instrument strengths; and provides a more parsimonious framework for asymptotic hypothesis testing compared to existing two-stage procedures.},

The goal of these analyses was to examine the prevalence and impact of comorbid chronic pain and cigarette smoking among PLWH. Participants included 3289 PLWH (83\% male) who were recruited from five HIV clinics. As expected, the prevalence of smoking was higher among PLWH with chronic pain (41.9\%), than PLWH without chronic pain (26.6\%, p {\textless} .0001), and the prevalence of chronic pain was higher among current smokers (32.9\%), than among former (23.6\%) or never (17\%) smokers (ps {\textless} .0001). PLWH who endorsed comorbid chronic pain and smoking (vs. nonsmokers without chronic pain) were more likely to report cocaine/crack and cannabis use, be prescribed long-term opioid therapy, and have virologic failure, even after controlling for relevant sociodemographic and substance-related variables (ps {\textless} .05). These results contribute to a growing empirical literature indicating that chronic pain and cigarette smoking frequently co-occur, and extend this work to a large sample of PLWH.

Studies have shown a potential relationship between perceived psychological stress and weight loss in behavioral interventions. This study sought to assess whether baseline stress was directly or indirectly associated with 6-month weight change among Black women participating in a behavioral weight loss study. Indirect pathways of interest included depressive symptoms and dietary intake. A secondary analysis of data (n = 409) collected from a cluster, randomized behavioral weight loss trial was conducted. Demographics, anthropometry, surveys, and dietary data were collected at baseline and 6 months. Path analysis was used to test for direct and indirect effects of baseline stress on 6-month weight change while controlling for sociodemographic factors and intervention group. Baseline stress was not directly associated with 6-month weight change nor was it indirectly associated via depressive symptoms in the adjusted model. However, each of the direct paths linking baseline stress to weight loss were statistically significant. Stress was not associated with 6-month weight change via dietary intake. Baseline stress was positively associated with 6-month depressive symptoms which in turn was associated with less weight change. Depressive symptoms may offer an additional psychosocial target to consider when designing behavioral weight loss interventions for Black women.},

Tools that aid providers in treatment selection, such as computer-generated algorithms, may address barriers to providing effective and efficient treatment options to their patients. OBJECTIVE: To test the effectiveness of a computer-generated smoking cessation pharmacotherapy recommendation algorithm fully integrated into HIV primary care against an enhanced usual care condition. METHODS: Six hundred adult smokers living with HIV will be recruited from 3 medical clinics that provide HIV care in Birmingham, AL, Seattle, WA, and Boston, MA. Participants will be asked to complete a baseline visit and 4 follow- up visits, which will include self-report assessments and carbon monoxide monitoring. Additionally, participants have the option to respond to weekly text-message based surveys sent over an 11-week period between baseline and end of treatment. Participants randomized to the AT condition will have a tailored, algorithm-generated smoking cessation pharmacotherapy recommendation delivered to their HIV care provider via EHR, with the potential to receive up to 12 weeks of smoking cessation pharmacotherapy. CONCLUSIONS: A smoking cessation pharmacotherapy recommendation algorithm integrated into HIV primary care may increase treatment utilization and smoking abstinence among smokers living with HIV. If successful, the intervention would be ready for use across the entire CFAR Network of Integrated Clinical Systems network and, more broadly, in HIV clinics that utilize an EHR system.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Data on the prevalence and correlates of restless legs syndrome (RLS) in people with HIV are limited. This study sought to determine the prevalence of RLS, associated clinical correlates, and characterize sleep-related differences in men with and without HIV. METHODS: Sleep-related data were collected in men who have sex with men participating in the Multicenter AIDS Cohort Study (MACS). Demographic, health behaviors, HIV status, comorbidities, and serological data were obtained from the MACS visit coinciding with sleep assessments. Participants completed questionnaires, home polysomnography, and wrist actigraphy. RLS status was determined with the Cambridge-Hopkins RLS questionnaire. RLS prevalence was compared in men with and without HIV. Multinomial logistic regression was used to examine correlates of RLS among all participants and men with HIV alone. Sleep-related differences were examined in men with and without HIV by RLS status. RESULTS: The sample consisted of 942 men (56\% HIV+; mean age 57 years; 69\% white). The prevalence of definite RLS was comparable in men with and without HIV (9.1\% vs 8.7\%). In multinomial regression, HIV status was not associated with RLS prevalence. However, white race, anemia, depression, and antidepressant use were each independently associated with RLS. HIV disease duration was also associated with RLS. Men with HIV and RLS reported poorer sleep quality, greater sleepiness, and had worse objective sleep efficiency/fragmentation than men without HIV/RLS. CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of RLS in men with and without HIV was similar. Screening for RLS may be considered among people with HIV with insomnia and with long-standing disease.},

We investigated longitudinal peripheral blood samples in 50 individuals with previously confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection, including 20 who experienced prolonged duration of COVID-19 symptoms (lasting more than 30 days; median = 74 days) compared with 30 who had symptom resolution within 20 days. Individuals with prolonged symptom duration maintained antigen-specific T cell response magnitudes to SARS-CoV-2 spike protein in CD4+ and circulating T follicular helper cell populations during late convalescence, while those without persistent symptoms demonstrated an expected decline. The prolonged group also displayed increased IgG avidity to SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. Significant correlations between symptom duration and both SARS-CoV-2-specific T cells and antibodies were observed. Activation and exhaustion markers were evaluated in multiple immune cell types, revealing few phenotypic differences between prolonged and recovered groups, suggesting that prolonged symptom duration is not due to persistent systemic inflammation. These findings demonstrate that SARS-CoV-2-specific immune responses are maintained in patients suffering from prolonged post- COVID-19 symptom duration in contrast to those with resolved symptoms and may suggest the persistence of viral antigens as an underlying etiology.},

Several Monte-Carlo studies investigate the performance of MR methods with binary outcomes, but few consider them in conjunction with binary risk factors. OBJECTIVE: To develop a novel MR estimator for scenarios with a binary risk factor and outcome; and compare to existing MR estimators via simulations and real data analysis. METHODS: A bivariate Bernoulli distribution is adapted to the IV setting. Empirical bias and asymptotic coverage probabilities are estimated via simulations. The proposed method is compared to the Wald method, two-stage predictor substitution (2SPS), two-stage residual inclusion (2SRI), and the generalized method of moments (GMM). An analysis is performed using existing data from the CLEAR study to estimate the potential causal effect of smoking on rheumatoid arthritis risk in African Americans. RESULTS: Bias was low for the proposed method and comparable to 2SPS. The Wald method was often biased towards the null. Coverage was adequate for the proposed method, 2SPS, and 2SRI. Coverage for the Wald and GMM methods was poor in several scenarios. The causal effect of ever smoking on rheumatoid arthritis risk was not statistically significant using a variety of genetic instruments. CONCLUSIONS: Simulations suggest the proposed MR method is sound with binary risk factors and outcomes, and comparable to 2SPS and 2SRI in terms of bias. The proposed method also provides more natural framework for hypothesis testing compared to 2SPS or 2SRI, which require ad-hoc variance adjustments.},

Our findings show increased frequencies of T cell activation markers (CD69, OX40, HLA-DR, and CD154) in hospitalized patients, with other T cell activation/exhaustion markers (PD-L1 and TIGIT) remaining elevated in hospitalized and nonhospitalized individuals. B cells had a similar pattern of activation/exhaustion, with increased frequency of CD69 and CD95 during hospitalization followed by an increase in PD1 frequencies in nonhospitalized individuals. Interestingly, many of these changes were found to increase over time in nonhospitalized longitudinal samples, suggesting a prolonged period of immune dysregulation after SARS-CoV-2 infection. Changes in T cell activation/exhaustion in nonhospitalized patients were found to positively correlate with age. Severely infected individuals had increased expression of activation and exhaustion markers.

METHODS: A total of 36 university students engaged in a virtual reality pedestrian environment in two conditions: sleep deprived (no sleep previous night) and normal sleep (normal sleep routine). Sleep was assessed using actigraphy and pedestrian behavior via four outcomes: time to initiate crossing, time before contact with oncoming vehicle, hits/close calls, and looks left/right. During each condition, participants made half the crossings while text messaging. Participants also completed the Useful Field of View test, the Psychomotor Vigilance Test, and Conners' Continuous Performance Test in both conditions. RESULTS: While sleep deprived, students crossed significantly closer to oncoming vehicles compared with after normal sleep. While text messaging, crossed closer to vehicles and took longer to initiate crossings. Safety risks were amplified through combined sleep deprivation plus text messaging, leading to more virtual hits and close calls and shorter time before vehicle contact while crossing. Sleep-deprived students demonstrated impairments in functioning on cognitive tests. CONCLUSIONS: University students' pedestrian behavior was generally riskier, and their cognitive functioning was impaired, when sleep deprived compared with after normal sleep. This effect was exacerbated when distracted by text messaging.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Our aim was to conduct a pilot randomized controlled trial of a novel cognitive behaviorally based intervention for pediatric PNES called Retraining and Control Therapy (ReACT). METHODS: Participants were randomized to receive either eight sessions of ReACT or supportive therapy, and participants completed follow-up visits at 7- and 60-days posttreatment. The primary outcome measure was PNES frequency at 7-days posttreatment. Eligibility criteria included children with video-EEG confirmed PNES and participant/parent or guardian willingness to participate in treatment. Exclusion criteria included substance use, psychosis, and severe intellectual disability. Forty-two patients were assessed for eligibility and 32 were randomized. ReACT aimed to retrain classically conditioned, involuntary PNES by targeting catastrophic symptom expectations and a low sense of control over symptoms using principles of habit reversal. Supportive therapy was based on the assumption that relief from stress or problems can be achieved by discussion with a therapist. RESULTS: Twenty-nine participants (Mage = 15.1 years, SDage = 2.5; 72.2\% female; 57.1\% Caucasian, 28.6\% African American) completed 7-days postprocedures. For PNES frequency, the Wilcoxon Rank Sum test statistic was 273.5 yielding a normal approximation of Z = 4.725 (P {\textless} 0.0001), indicating a significant improvement in PNES frequency for ReACT at 7-days posttreatment compared to supportive therapy. Participants with PNES in the 7-days posttreatment were removed from the study for additional treatment, resulting in no 60-day follow-up data for supportive therapy. INTERPRETATION: ReACT resulted in significantly greater PNES reduction than supportive therapy, with 100\% of patients experiencing no PNES in 7 days after ReACT. Additionally, 82\% remained PNES-free for 60 days after ReACT.},

	abstract = {Purpose: Despite reportedly high rates of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and other sexually transmitted infections (STIs) among transgender people, laboratory-proven prevalence of these infections in this population has not been systematically reviewed. We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis of the medical literature involving laboratory-proven HIV and STI diagnoses among transgender people. Methods: A systematic review of the English literature regarding laboratory-proven HIV and/or STI testing in transgender populations within the last 50 years was performed. Preliminary meta-analyses assessing the prevalence of HIV and STIs among both transgender men and transgender women were performed. Given the heterogeneity of included studies, these analyses were difficult to interpret and not included in our results. Results: Our literature review identified 25 studies, representing 11 countries. All of these studies included transgender women, with 9 (36\%) including data on transgender men. HIV was the most commonly studied STI, with prevalence ranging from 0\% to 49.6\% in transgender women and 0\% to 8.3\% in transgender men. For syphilis, gonorrhea, and chlamydia, respectively, prevalence ranged from 1.4\% to 50.4\%, 2.1\% to 19.1\%, and 2.7\% to 24.7\% in transgender women and from 0\% to 4.2\%, 0\% to 10.5\%, and 1.2\% to 11.1\% in transgender men. Site-specific testing practices for gonorrhea and chlamydia were variable. No studies reported prevalence data on trichomoniasis. Conclusion: The literature describing STIs and transgender people primarily focuses on transgender women and HIV. Data involving HIV and STIs among transgender men are lacking. These findings highlight opportunities for the future study of epidemiology of HIV/STIs in transgender men and the relevance of STIs in transgender people.},

	abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Smoking cessation treatments currently succeed at a rate of approximately 20\%-30\%, underscoring the importance of exploring factors that might increase intervention effectiveness. Although negative affect has been studied extensively in relation to smoking cessation, psychological well-being (PWB; eg, life satisfaction, optimism, positive affect, purpose in life) has received little attention. This study tested longitudinal and reciprocal relationships between PWB and smoking status in older adults. METHODS: Panel data were obtained from the biennial, longitudinal Health and Retirement Study. Using structural equation modeling, we developed cross-lagged models to examine the relationships of PWB in 2006 with smoking status in 2010 and of smoking status in 2006 with PWB in 2010 while controlling for covariates (Ns = 2939-4230, 55\% women, 89\% white, mean age = 64 years, mean years of education = 13, 25\% smokers in 2006 and 21\% smokers in 2010). Separate cross-lagged models were developed for each of the PWB variables: life satisfaction, optimism, positive affect, and purpose in life. RESULTS: Greater life satisfaction (standardized path coefficient = -0.04), optimism (standardized path coefficient = -0.07), and positive affect (standardized path coefficient = -0.08) in 2006 predicted a reduced likelihood of smoking in 2010. Being a smoker in 2006 predicted lower life satisfaction (standardized path coefficient = -0.25), optimism (standardized path coefficient = -0.10), positive affect (standardized path coefficient = -0.10), and purpose in life (standardized path coefficient = -0.13) in 2010. CONCLUSIONS: Findings warrant further exploration of the relationships between PWB and smoking, and support the incorporation of PWB-boosting components into existing treatments. IMPLICATIONS: Given the relatively low success rate of current smoking cessation treatments, the present results suggest that increasing PWB might promote abstinence and therefore warrant consideration as a focus of future cessation treatment research. Moreover, these results suggest that smoking might inhibit PWB, illuminating a negative consequence of smoking not previously identified. Helping smokers increase their PWB may benefit them beyond promoting cessation and contribute to a flourishing society. These results warrant further investigation of PWB and smoking, and support the continued evaluation of PWB-boosting components in smoking cessation treatments.},

The objective of this review is to discuss assumptions, strengths, and shortcomings of currently available methods of this estimation. Articles from 2000 to 2018 on methods to estimate PUHIV were reviewed. Back- calculation methods including CD4 depletion and test-retest use diagnosis CD4 count, or previous testing history to determine likely infection time thus, providing an estimate of PUHIV for previous years. Biomarker methods use immunoassays to differentiate recent from older infections. Statistical techniques treat HIV status as missing data and impute data for models of infection. Lastly, population surveys using HIV rapid testing most accurately calculates the current HIV prevalence. Although multiple methods exist to estimate the number of PUHIV, the appropriate method for future applications depends on multiple factors, namely data availability and population of interest.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Public health experts recommend school-based policies as a population based approach to increase youth physical activity. The purpose of this case study is to describe one, largely rural, state's efforts to translate this recommendation into practice. Details about the genesis, implementation and evolution of two state level policies (physical education and physical activity), as well as in-house efforts of a State Department of Education to monitor policy compliance and challenges encountered are described. Two specific years are highlighted, due to policy and monitoring enhancements made during those particular time periods. METHODS: Data for this paper come from the West Virginia Department of Education for two time periods: 2013-2014 and 2014-2015 (n=369 elementary schools). Descriptive statistics for quantitative data and content analysis for qualitative data were used to document school level compliance and provide context for implementation challenges. RESULTS: Greater than 70\% of school principals reported achievement of physical education and physical activity policy expectations for each year. Limited staff was the predominant explanation for nonfulfillment of physical education expectations, followed by lack of time and facilities. Recess and classroom-based physical activity were the primary strategies used to comply with the physical activity expectations. PE and PA policy compliance varied significantly by certain school characteristics in each school year studied. CONCLUSIONS: Further investigation is warranted on how states translate public health policy recommendations into practice, including how physical education and physical activity policies are developed and monitored at the state level and how to support states and schools with monitoring and implementation challenges.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: The Alabama Quality Management Group (AQMG), a consortium of 9 Ryan White-funded part C and D clinics, distributed statewide was established in 2006 under the guidance from the Health and Resources Services Administration with a clinical quality improvement (CQI) focus. METHODS: We describe the origins and evolution of the AQMG, including requisite shifts from aggregate clinic-wide to de-identified individual- level data reporting for implementation of the Data for Care (D4C-AL) Alabama program. The D4C-AL strategy uses a clinic-wide risk stratification of all patients based on missed clinic visits in the previous 12 months. Intermediate (1-2 missed visits) and high-risk patients ({\textgreater}3 missed visits) receive the evidence-informed Retention through Enhanced Personal Contact intervention. We report on a pilot of the D4CAL program in 4 of 33 primary HIV care clinics at the UAB 1917 Clinic. RESULTS: Among 3859 patients seen between April 2018 and February 2019, the missed visit rate was not significantly different between the D4C-1917 (19.2\%) and non-D4C clinics (20.5\%) in a preintervention period (May 2017-April 2018). However, a significantly lower missed visit rate was observed in the D4C-1917 vs. non-D4C-1917 clinics during the intervention period (April 2018-February 2019, P = 0.049). CONCLUSIONS: The AQMG has been transformed into a health service research and implementation science platform, building on a shared vision, mission, data reporting, and quality improvement focus. Moreover, CQI may be viewed as an implementation strategy that seeks to enhance uptake and sustained use of effective interventions with D4C-AL representing a prototype for future initiatives embedded within extant quality improvement consortia.},

This study examined feasibility of an online personalized nutrition tracking application, Good Measures (GM), with patients at seven health care clinics throughout the state. Fourteen healthcare providers and 64 patients 18 years or older with a Body Mass Index (BMI) greater than or equal to 30 and access to the Internet were recruited for this 12-week feasibility study. Patient participants logged meals and exercise into the GM application via smart phone, tablet, or computer and virtually engaged with a Registered Dietitian Nutritionist (RDN) in one-on-one sessions. The primary endpoint was to examine feasibility of the program by usage of the application and feedback questions regarding the benefits and challenges of the application. Participants were predominately white (92\%) and female (76\%). Minimal improvements in weight and systolic blood pressure were found. Participant attitude survey data declined from 4-weeks to 12-weeks of the intervention. Interestingly though, patients in a rural clinic had lesser declines in attitudes than peri-urban participants. Qualitative feedback data identified participants predominately had a positive overall feeling toward the approach. Participants expressed favorability of RDN access, the variety of foods, but did give suggestions for in-person meetings and more updating of the application. Implementing a technology approach to nutrition in rural areas of West Virginia using a mobile application with RDN access may be one strategy to address public health issues such as obesity.},

There is hope that marijuana may reduce prescription opioid use. Our objective was to investigate whether marijuana use among PLWH who have chronic pain is associated with changes in pain severity and prescribed opioid use (prescribed opioid initiation and discontinuation). METHODS: Participants completed self-report measures of chronic pain and marijuana use at an index visit and were followed up for 1 year in the Center for AIDS Research Network of Integrated Clinical Systems (CNICS). Self-reported marijuana use was the exposure variable. Outcome variables were changes in pain and initiation or discontinuation of opioids during the study period. The relationship between exposure and outcomes was assessed using generalized linear models for pain and multivariable binary logistic regression models for opioid initiation/discontinuation. RESULTS: Of 433 PLWH and chronic pain, 28\% reported marijuana use in the past 3 months. Median pain severity at the index visit was 6.3/10 (interquartile range 4.7-8.0). Neither increases nor decreases in marijuana use were associated with changes in pain severity, and marijuana use was not associated with either lower odds of opioid initiation or higher odds of opioid discontinuation. CONCLUSIONS: We did not find evidence that marijuana use in PLWH is associated with improved pain outcomes or reduced opioid prescribing. This suggests that caution is warranted when counseling PLWH about potential benefits of recreational or medical marijuana.},

	abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Compared to the general population, smoking rates are 2-4 times higher among individuals with opioid use disorders (OUDs). These smokers also have poor long-term cessation rates, even with pharmacotherapy or other interventions. Low success rates with traditional approaches may prompt smokers with OUDs to try more novel products like electronic cigarettes (ECIGs). This pilot study was designed to examine the feasibility, acceptability, and effect of ECIGs on smoking behavior among smokers with OUD. METHODS: Participants (N=25) were daily smokers receiving buprenorphine/naloxone for OUD at an outpatient clinic. They were randomized to use a second-generation ECIG (0 or 18ng/ml nicotine) ad libitum for two weeks while completing assessments via text messaging daily, and also via in-person visits at baseline, end of the two-week intervention, and a 4-week follow-up. RESULTS: Feasibility was evidenced by high enrollment (93.9\%) and retention (70.9\%) rates. ECIG adherence was relatively high as measured by self-report (80.6\% active, 91.7\% placebo), while the average volume of liquid used per week was low ({\textasciitilde}3ml). Both ECIG doses produced reductions in self-reported cigarettes per day that were not supported by average carbon monoxide levels. Biologically-confirmed smoking abstinence was observed in 8\% of participants. CONCLUSIONS: Preliminary results suggest that smokers with OUD are interested in using ECIGs, but their adherence may be less than ideal. Poor medication adherence rates are often observed in this disparate population, and future work should consider the use of other ECIG device types and a combination of methods to verify and quantify ECIG use.},

Current prenatal STI screening guidelines define "risk" without explicit consideration of HIV status. Our objective was to test the hypothesis that HIV status is associated with bacterial STI in pregnant women. Methods: We designed a retrospective cohort study to identify pregnant women with HIV who delivered at our facility during 2000-2014. HIV+ women were compared to HIV- women with matching by year of delivery. Logistic regression was used to model adjusted odds of prevalent and incident STI. Prevalent STI was defined as chlamydia (CT), gonorrhea (GC), syphilis, or trichomoniasis detected on an initial prenatal screening test and incident STI as a newly positive result following a negative prenatal test. Results: The cohort included 432 women, 210 HIV+ and 222 HIV-. Most pregnant women were screened for STI (92\% of HIV+ women and 74\% of HIV- women). STI rates were high and particularly elevated in HIV+ women: 29\% vs 18\% (p=0.02), for prevalent STI and 11\% vs 2\% (p{\textless}0.001) for incident STI. Risk factors for prevalent STI were as follows: HIV status (aOR 3.0, CI: 1.4-6.4), Black race (aOR 2.7, 95\% CI: 1.1-6.6), and more recent delivery (2007-2014 compared to 2000-2006) (aOR 2.3, CI: 1.1-4.7). HIV status was an independent risk factor for incident STI (aOR 7.2, CI: 2.1-25.0). Conclusion: Pregnant women who delivered in our center had high STI rates. Since HIV infection was independently associated with prevalent and incident STI, prenatal screening guidelines may need to incorporate HIV status as a high-risk group for repeat testing.},

We used data on 12,497 black and 17,660 white participants enrolled in the United States (2003-2007) and collected incident risk factor data approximately 10 years after baseline. At follow-up, 21.0\% of white participants and 23.0\% of black participants had died; additionally 22.0\% of white participants and 28.4\% of black participants had withdrawn. Individual probabilities of completing the follow-up visit were estimated using baseline demographic and health characteristics. Adjusted risk ratio estimates of racial disparities from complete-case analyses in both incident hypertension (1.11, 95\% confidence interval: 1.02, 1.21) and incident left ventricular hypertrophy (1.02, 95\% confidence interval: 0.84, 1.24) were virtually identical to estimates from inverse probability of attrition weighting and survivor average causal effect. Despite racial differences in mortality and attrition, we found little evidence of selection bias in the estimation of racial differences for these incident risk factors.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Living donor kidney transplantation has declined in the United States since 2004, but the relationship between population characteristics and rate of living donation is unknown. The goal of our study was to use data on general population health and socioeconomic status to investigate the association with living donation. METHODS: This cross-sectional, ecological study used population health and socioeconomic status data from the CDC Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System to investigate the association with living donation. Transplant centers performing 10 or greater kidney transplants reported to the Scientific Registry of Transplant Recipients in 2015 were included. Center rate of living donation was defined as the proportion of all kidney transplants performed at a center that were from living donors. RESULTS: In a linear mixed-effects model, a composite index of health and socioeconomic status factors was negatively associated with living donation, with a rate of living donation that was on average 7.3 percentage points lower among centers in areas with more comorbid disease and poorer socioeconomic status (95\% confidence interval, -12.2 to -2.3, P = 0.004). Transplant centers in areas with higher prevalence of minorities had a rate of living donation that was 7.1 percentage points lower than centers with fewer minorities (95\% confidence interval, -11.8 to -2.3, P = 0.004). CONCLUSIONS: Center-level variation in living donation was associated with population characteristics and minority prevalence. Further examination of these factors in the context of patient and center-level barriers to living donation is warranted.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF) increases serum parathyroid hormone (PTH) and 1,25 dihydroxy vitamin D (1,25-(OH)2D), and decreases bone mineral density (BMD). Optimal treatment of TDF-associated BMD loss requires an understanding of the primary cause of these abnormalities. METHODS: Secondary review of data from two studies of TDF use in youth, comparing the relationship of PTH, 25-hydroxy vitamin D (25-OHD) and 1,25-(OH)2D in three groups with varying exposures to TDF: youth without HIV enrolled in a trial of TDF/emtricitabine (FTC) for HIV pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) at baseline (no TDF exposure) and after 12 weeks of TDF (short-term TDF exposure); and youth with HIV treated with TDF-containing combination antiretroviral therapy (cART) for at least 6 months at study entry (long-term TDF exposure). Relationships were evaluated by correlation analyses. RESULTS: Participants ranged in age from 17 to 24 years and {\textgreater}50\% were Black/African American. In persons not treated with TDF, PTH had the physiologically appropriate negative correlation with 25-OHD (r=-0.3504, P=0.004). Correlations between PTH and 25-OHD in groups treated with TDF were weaker or absent. With longer term TDF treatment in persons with HIV, 25-OHD and 1,25-(OH)2D had the positive correlation similar to that found in vitamin D deficiency. CONCLUSIONS: TDF changes the relationship of 25-OHD to PTH, suggesting that in persons using TDF for PrEP or cART, a higher than usual target for serum 25-OHD concentration might be needed to reduce PTH and optimize bone health.

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Chronic pain occurs in up to 85\% of persons living with HIV and is commonly treated with long-term opioid therapy (LTOT). We investigated the impact of chronic pain and LTOT on HIV outcomes. METHODS: This was prospective cohort study conducted between July 2015 and July 2016 in 5 HIV primary care clinics. Chronic pain was defined as {\textgreater}/=moderate pain for {\textgreater}/=3 months on the Brief Chronic Pain Questionnaire. Chronic pain and LTOT were assessed at an index visit. Suboptimal retention, defined as at least one "no-show" to primary care, and virologic failure were measured over the subsequent year. Multivariable logistic regression models were built for each outcome adjusting for site. RESULTS: Among 2334 participants, 25\% had chronic pain, 27\% had suboptimal retention, 12\% had virologic failure, and 19\% were prescribed LTOT. Among individuals not on LTOT, chronic pain was associated with increased odds of suboptimal retention [adjusted odds ratio (aOR) 1.46, 95\% confidence interval (CI): 1.10 to 1.93, P = 0.009] and virologic failure (aOR 1.97, 95\% CI: 1.39 to 2.80, P {\textless} 0.001). Among individuals with chronic pain, there was no association between LTOT and retention, but LTOT was associated with lower rates of virologic failure (aOR 0.56, 95\% CI: 0.33 to 0.96, P = 0.03). CONCLUSIONS: Chronic pain in participants not on LTOT was associated with virologic failure. This reinforces the need to identify effective chronic pain treatments for persons living with HIV and investigate their impact on HIV outcomes. The apparent protective association between LTOT and virologic failure in those with pain merits further exploration.},

Patients and Methods: A total of 142,433 patients aged {\textgreater}/=66 years diagnosed with stage I-III breast cancer between 2007 and 2011 were identified in the SEER-Medicare linked database. Algorithms considering cancer characteristics and the appropriate course of care as per guidelines versus actual care received determined receipt of GCC. Multivariable logistic regression estimated the likelihood of GCC and specific types of treatment for women aged {\textgreater}/=75 versus 66 to 74 years. Results: Overall, 39.7\% of patients received GCC. Patients diagnosed at stage II or III, with certain preexisting conditions, and of nonwhite race were less likely to receive GCC. Patients with hormone-negative tumors, higher grade tumors, and greater access to oncology care resources were more likely to receive GCC. Patients aged {\textgreater}/=75 years were approximately 40\% less likely to receive GCC or adjuvant endocrine therapy, 78\% less likely to have any surgery, 61\% less likely to have chemotherapy, and about half as likely to have radiation therapy than those aged 66 to 74 years. Conclusions: Fewer than half of older women with breast cancer received GCC, with the lowest rates observed among the oldest age groups, racial/ethnic minorities, and women with later-stage cancers. However, patients with more aggressive tumor characteristics and greater access to oncology resources were more likely to receive GCC. Considering that older women have the highest incidence of breast cancer and that many are diagnosed at stages requiring more aggressive treatment, efforts to increase rates of earlier stage diagnosis and the development of less toxic treatments could help improve GCC and survival while preserving quality of life.},

Catastrophic thinking is a clinically relevant and potentially modifiable factor associated with several chronic pain outcomes, including risk for opioid misuse. This study examined the utility of a single-item measure of pain-related catastrophizing in predicting risk of opioid misuse. METHOD: 119 chronic pain patients completed the Coping Strategies Questionnaire catastrophizing item, Pain Catastrophizing Scale (PCS), and Screener and Opioid Assessment for Patients with Pain-Revised (SOAPP-R). Area under the receiver operator curve (AUC) and linear regression were used to examine predictive utility of the catastrophizing item. RESULTS: The catastrophizing item demonstrated a fair ability to discriminate those with high risk for opioid misuse on the SOAPP-R (AUC = 0.74), whereas the PCS demonstrated good discrimination (AUC = 0.85). The single item alone accounted for 30\% of variance in SOAPP-R scores. CONCLUSION: A single question assessing pain catastrophizing has utility for predicting risk for opioid misuse. In addition, it provides the primary care provider with information on a potentially modifiable risk factor that can be addressed within the context of a brief clinical visit.},

A survey-based study was conducted to determine whether Internal Medicine (IM) and Family Medicine (FM) pharmacists and physicians differed in their attitudes regarding the benefits of collaboration in an acute care setting. OBJECTIVES: The primary objective was to evaluate perceived differences regarding self-assessment of value between IM and FM pharmacists. The secondary objective was to evaluate perceived differences of clinical pharmacist benefit between IM and FM physicians. METHODS: An eight-item questionnaire assessed the attitudes and beliefs of pharmacists and physicians regarding the value of clinical pharmacy services. Surveys were emailed and participants marked their responses using a 7-point Likert scale for each item. Demographic data and overall comments were collected from each participant. KEY FINDINGS: Overall, 167 surveys were completed. When comparing cumulative physician and pharmacist responses, none of the eight questions showed significant differences. Statistically significant differences were noted when comparing IM and FM clinical pharmacists on five of the eight survey items; for each of these items, FM pharmacists had more favourable perceptions than their IM counterparts. No statistically significant differences were noted when comparing responses of IM and FM physicians. CONCLUSIONS: This study found that FM pharmacists perceived a greater benefit regarding participation in inpatient acute care rounds when compared to their IM pharmacist counterparts. Future studies are necessary to determine if other medical specialties' perceptions of clinical pharmacy provision differ from our findings and to evaluate the rationale behind specific attitudes and behaviours.},

The final model, consisting of priority and extended measures, demonstrates moderate discriminatory power, indicating that it could prove useful in a clinical setting for identifying patients at risk of falls.

In the setting of residual use of creatine kinase M and B isoenzyme testing for myocardial infarction, we assessed disease outcomes of discordant creatine kinase M and B isoenzyme +/troponin I (-) test pairs in order to address anticipated clinician concerns about potential loss of case-finding sensitivity following proposed discontinuation of routine creatine kinase and creatine kinase M and B isoenzyme testing. Time- sequenced interventions were introduced. The main outcome was the percentage of cardiac marker studies performed within guidelines. Nonguideline orders dominated at baseline. Creatine kinase M and B isoenzyme testing in 7496 order sets failed to detect additional myocardial infarctions but was associated with 42 potentially preventable admissions/quarter. Interruptive computerized soft stops improved guideline compliance from 32.3\% to 58\% (P {\textless} .001) in services not receiving peer leader intervention and to {\textgreater}80\% (P {\textless} .001) with peer leadership that featured dashboard feedback about test order performance. This successful experience was recapitulated in interrupted time series within 2 additional services within facility 1 and then in 2 external hospitals (including a critical access facility). Improvements have been sustained postintervention. Laboratory cost savings at the academic facility were estimated to be {\textgreater}/=US\$635 000 per year. National collaborative data indicated that facility 1 improved its order patterns from fourth to first quartile compared to peer norms and imply that nonguideline orders persist elsewhere. This example illustrates how pathologists can provide leadership in assisting clinicians in changing laboratory ordering practices. We found that clinicians respond to local laboratory data about their own test performance and that evidence suggesting harm is more compelling to clinicians than evidence of cost savings. Our experience indicates that interventions done at an academic facility can be readily instituted by private practitioners at external facilities. The intervention data also supplement existing literature that electronic order interruptions are more successful when combined with modalities that rely on peer education combined with dashboard feedback about laboratory order performance. The findings may have implications for the role of the pathology laboratory in the ongoing pivot from quantity-based to value-based health care.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: We investigate how West Virginia University football games affect transport to Ruby Memorial Hospital, which shares a parking lot with Milan Puskar Football Stadium. METHODS: A retrospective chart review of a trauma registry from a level 1-trauma center was conducted from 2007 to 2011 for all home and away football games. Home games served as time period of interest and away games served as a control time period. Patient charts were collected for a 36-hour time window surrounding the game. 250 patient charts were complete for home games and 185 patient charts for away games. Data analyzed were time from scene to arrival at hospital, use of air transport, transport time in relation to kick-off, and comparison between demographic and emergency department disposition of patients arriving during home games vs. patients arriving during away games. RESULTS: No statistically significant differences were found for demographic data or emergency department disposition between groups. For ground transport directly from scene, the average time to arrival at the hospital was 44.9 minutes for home games and 45.1 minutes for away games. For air transport directly from the scene, the average time to arrival at the hospital was 44.9 minutes for home games and 44.0 minutes for away games. For ground transfer from another facility, the average time to arrival at the hospital was 76.4 minutes for home games and 52.9 minutes for away games. For air transport from another facility, the average time to arrival at the hospital was 37.4 minutes for home games and 24.0 minutes for away games. Air transportation utilization was increased in inter-facility transfers during home games (5/16, 31.3\% vs. 4/20, 22.2\%), and helicopters traveled a further distance (avg. 66.6 vs. 50.25 air miles). For patients coming from the scene during a home game, if the start of the game occurred after the trauma but before arrival to the trauma center, the average time of ground transport increased from 44.9 minutes to 120 minutes (p{\textless}0.0001). CONCLUSION: A mass gathering in close proximity to a rural trauma center does affect transport patterns and transport times for trauma patients. Further investigation is warranted in order to improve patient care during mass gathering events.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Informaticians at any institution that are developing clinical research support infrastructure are tasked with populating research databases with data extracted and transformed from their institution's operational databases, such as electronic health records (EHRs). These data must be properly extracted from these source systems, transformed into a standard data structure, and then loaded into the data warehouse while maintaining the integrity of these data. We validated the correctness of the extract, load, and transform (ETL) process of the extracted data of West Virginia Clinical and Translational Science Institute's Integrated Data Repository, a clinical data warehouse that includes data extracted from two EHR systems. METHODS: Four hundred ninety-eight observations were randomly selected from the integrated data repository and compared with the two source EHR systems. RESULTS: Of the 498 observations, there were 479 concordant and 19 discordant observations. The discordant observations fell into three general categories: a) design decision differences between the IDR and source EHRs, b) timing differences, and c) user interface settings. After resolving apparent discordances, our integrated data repository was found to be 100\% accurate relative to its source EHR systems. CONCLUSION: Any institution that uses a clinical data warehouse that is developed based on extraction processes from operational databases, such as EHRs, employs some form of an ETL process. As secondary use of EHR data begins to transform the research landscape, the importance of the basic validation of the extracted EHR data cannot be underestimated and should start with the validation of the extraction process itself.},

We compared those that were treated at initial facility and those transferred to a second facility using clinical indices including patterns of injury pattern using multivariate logistic regression. Of the 4441 patients who fit our inclusion criteria, 801 (18\%) were transferred. Younger age groups were more likely to be transferred. Factors associated with being transferred included head, spinal, and facial injuries, and patient arrival during the nighttime work shifts. In conclusion, young patients who have signs of possible neurological or spinal injuries and those who arrive during nondaytime shifts during the workday are more likely to be transferred to another trauma center.

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Secondary overtriage (SO) refers to the interfacility transfer of trauma patients who are rapidly discharged home without surgical intervention by the receiving institution. SO imposes a financial hardship on patients and strains trauma center resources. Most studies on SO have been conducted from the perspective of the receiving hospital, which is usually a level 1 trauma center. Having previously studied SO from the referring rural hospital's perspective, we sought to identify variables contributing to SO at the national level. METHODS: Using data from the 2008-2012 National Trauma Data Bank, we isolated patients transferred to level 1 trauma centers who were: (1) discharged home within 48 h and (2) did not undergo any surgical procedure. This population was subsequently compared with similar patients treated at and discharged directly from level 3 and 4 centers. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was used to isolate variables that independently influenced a patient's risk of undergoing SO. Injury patterns were characterized by use of subspecialty consultants. RESULTS: A total of 99,114 patients met inclusion criteria, of which 13.2\% were discharged directly from level 3 or 4 trauma centers, and 86.8\% of them were transferred to a level 1 trauma center before discharge. The mean Injury Severity Score of the nontransfer and transfer groups was 5.4 +/- 4.5 and 7.3 +/- 5.7, respectively. Multivariate regression analysis showed that Injury Severity Score {\textgreater} 15, alcoholism, smoking, drug use, and certain injury patterns involving the head, vertebra, and face were associated with being transferred. In this minimally injured population, factors protective against transfers were: age {\textgreater} 65 y, female gender, systolic blood pressure {\textless}80, a head computed tomography scan and orthopedic injuries. CONCLUSIONS: SO results from the complex interplay of variables including patient demographics, facility characteristics, and injury type. The inability to exclude a potentially devastating neurologic injury seems to drive SO.},

	abstract = {AIMS: Perfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) are synthetic hydrocarbons shown to preserve pancreatic islet cell viability and reduce islet cell hypoxia and apoptosis. We investigated the relationship of serum PFAS with diabetes, and whether this varied by diabetes type. METHODS: 6,460 individuals with and 60,439 without diabetes from the C8 Health Project, were categorized into three groups: type 1 (n=820), type 2 (n=4,291), or uncategorized diabetes (n=1,349, missing data on diabetes type or diabetes based on blood sugar at study entry). Four PFAS were investigated: perfluorohexane sulfonate (PFHxS), perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA), perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS), and perfluorononaoic acid (PFNA). RESULTS: PFAS levels were significantly lower in those with diabetes, and lowest in those with type 1 diabetes. In age and sex adjusted analyses, ORs (CI) for type 1, type 2, and uncategorized diabetes compared to no diabetes were 0.59 (0.54-0.64), 0.74 (0.71-0.77), 0.84 (0.78-0.90), respectively for PFHxS; 0.69 (0.65-0.74), 0.87 (0.89-0.91), 0.92 (0.88-0.97), respectively for PFOA; 0.65 (0.61-0.70), 0.86 (0.82-0.90), 0.93 (0.86-1.03), respectively for PFOS; and 0.65 (0.57-0.74), 0.94 (0.88-1.00), 0.95 (0.85-1.06), respectively for PFNA. Further adjustment for eGFR and other covariates did not eliminate these inverse associations. CONCLUSIONS: PFAS levels were negatively associated with diabetes. This inverse relationship was strongest for type 1 diabetes, suggesting the relationship with serum PFAS may vary with the severity of islet cell deficiency.},

	abstract = {AIMS: Elderly patients with diabetes are at increased fracture risk. Although long exposure to hyperglycemia may increase fracture risk via adverse effects on bone metabolism, tight glycemic control may increase risk via trauma subsequent to hypoglycemia. We tested the prospective relationship between glycemic control and fracture risk in 10,572 elderly patients (age {\textgreater}/=65) with diabetes. METHODS: Geriatric patients with diabetes were drawn from Vanderbilt University Medical Center's Electronic Health Record. Baseline was defined as age at first HbA1c after the latter of age 65 or ICD 9 code for diabetes. Cox analysis was used to test the relationship of updated mean HbA1c (average HbA1c over follow-up) with time to first fracture since baseline. HbA1c was categorized as follows: {\textless}6.5\% [{\textless}48mmol/mol]; 6.5-6.9\% [48-52mmol/mol]; 7-7.9\% [53-63mmol/mol]; 8-8.9\% [64-74 mmol-mol]; {\textgreater}/=9\% [{\textgreater}/=75mmol/mol]. The number of BMI measurements was used as a surrogate for relative frequency of outpatient visits, i.e. patient-provider contacts. RESULTS: During follow-up, there were 949 fracture events. HbA1c demonstrated a cubic relationship with fracture risk (p{\textless}0.05). In analyses accounting for age, sex, race, and number of BMI measures (a surrogate for patient- provider interaction), compared to an HbA1c of 7-7.9\%, HRs (95\% CIs) were: HbA1c{\textless}6.5\% HR=0.97 (0.82-1.14), 6.5-6.9\% HR=0.80 (0.66-0.97), 8-8.9\% HR=1.13 (0.92-1.40), {\textgreater}/=9\% HR=1.19 (0.93-1.54). CONCLUSIONS: An HbA1c of 6.5-6.9\% is associated with the lowest risk of fracture in elderly patients with diabetes. Risk associated with an HbA1c {\textgreater}/=9\% may be a marker of infrequent patient-provider interaction.},

However, challenges in incorporating fall risk screening into primary care result in a problem of missed opportunities for screening, counseling, intervention, and ultimately prevention. Given these barriers, this study examines the potential for the innovative use of routinely collected electronic health record data to provide enhanced clinical decision support in busy, often resource-thin primary care environments. Using de-identified data from a sample of West Virginia primary care centers, we find that it is both feasible and worthwhile to repurpose routinely collected data for the purpose of identification of older adults at risk of falls.

The goal of this study was to compare conventional echocardiographic measurements and speckle-tracking based strain imaging analyses in a small animal model of type 1 diabetes mellitus. Conventional analyses revealed differences in ejection fraction, fractional shortening, cardiac output, and stroke volume in diabetic animals relative to controls at 6-weeks post-diabetic onset. In contrast, when assessing short- and long-axis speckle-tracking based strain analyses, diabetic mice showed changes in average systolic radial strain, radial strain rate, radial displacement, and radial velocity, as well as decreased circumferential and longitudinal strain rate, as early as 1-week post-diabetic onset and persisting throughout the diabetic study. Further, we performed regional analyses for the LV and found that the free wall region was affected in both the short- and long-axis when assessing radial dimension parameters. These changes began 1-week post- diabetic onset and remained throughout the progression of the disease. These findings demonstrate the use of speckle-tracking based strain as an approach to elucidate cardiac dysfunction from a global perspective, identifying left ventricular cardiac regions affected during the progression of type 1 diabetes mellitus earlier than contractile changes detected by conventional echocardiographic measurements.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Rural hospitals have variable degrees of involvement within the nationwide trauma system because of differences in resources and operational goals. "Secondary overtriage" refers to the patient who is discharged home shortly after being transferred from another hospital. An analysis of these occurrences is useful to determine the efficiency of the trauma system as a whole. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Data were extracted from a statewide trauma registry from 2007-2012 to include those who were (1) discharged home within 48 h of arrival and (2) did not undergo a surgical procedure. We then identified those who arrived as a transfer before being discharged (secondary overtriage) from those who arrived from the scene. Factors associated with transfers were analyzed using a logistic regression. Injuries were classified based on the need of a specific consultant. Time of arrival to the emergency department was analyzed using 8-h blocks, with the 7 AM-3 PM block as reference. RESULTS: A total of 19,319 patients fit our inclusion criteria of which 1897 (9.8\%) arrived as transfers. Descriptive analysis showed a number of differences between transfers and nontransfers because of our large sample size. Thus, we examined variables that had more clinical significance using logistic regression controlling for age, injury severity score, the type of injury, blood products given, the time of arrival to initial emergency room, and whether a computed tomography scan was obtained initially. Factors associated with being transferred were injury severity score {\textgreater}15, transfusion of packed-red-blood-cells, graveyard-shift arrivals, and neurosurgical, spine, and facial injuries. Patients having a computed tomography scan were less likely to be transferred. CONCLUSIONS: Secondary overtriage may result from the hospital's limited resources. Some of these limitations are the availability of surgical specialists, blood products, and overall coverage during the "graveyard-shift." However, some of these transfers may be appropriate even though patients are ultimately discharged shortly after transfer.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: There are 62 million Americans currently residing in rural areas who are more likely to have multiple chronic conditions and be economically disadvantaged, and in poor health, receive less recommended preventive services and attend fewer visits to health care providers. Recent advances in mobile healthcare (mHealth) offer a promising new approach to solving health disparities and improving chronic illness care. It is now possible and affordable to transmit health information, including values from glucometers, automated blood pressure monitors, and scales, through Bluetooth-enabled devices. Additionally, audio and video communications technologies can allow healthcare providers to conduct many parts of a physical exam remotely from varied settings. These technologies could remove geographical distance as a barrier to care and diminish the access to care issues faced by patients who live rurally. However, currently there is lack of studies that provide evidence of feasibility, acceptability, and effectiveness of mHealth initiatives on improved outcomes of care, a needed step to make the translation to implementation studies in healthcare systems. The purpose of this paper is to present the protocol for the first study of mI SMART (mobile Improvement of Self-Management Ability through Rural Technology), a new integrated mHealth intervention. METHODS: Our objective is to provide evidence of feasibility and acceptability for the use of mI SMART in an underserved population and establish evidence for the refinement of mI SMART. The proposed study will take place at Milan Puskar Health Right, a free primary care clinic in the state of West Virginia. The clinic provides health care at no cost to uninsured, low income; adults aged 18-64 living in West Virginia. We will enroll 30 participants into this feasibility study with plans of implementing a longitudinal randomized, comparative effectiveness design in the future. Data collection will include tracking of barriers and facilitators to using mI SMART on patient and provider feedback surveys, tracking of patient-provider communications, self-reports from patients on quality of life, adherence, and self-management ability, and capture of health record data on chronic illness measures. DISCUSSION: We expect that the mI SMART intervention, refined from participant and provider feedback, will be acceptable and feasible. We anticipate high patient-provider satisfaction, enhanced patient-provider communication, and improved health related quality of life, adherence to treatment, and self-management ability. In addition, we hypothesize that patients who use mI SMART will demonstrate improved physical outcomes such as blood glucose, blood pressure, and weight.},

Since high levels of oxyradicals and lower antioxidant levels in septic patients are believed to result in multiorgan failure, uric acid levels could be used as a marker of oxidative stress and poor prognosis in patients with sepsis. Design. We conducted a prospective cohort study on Medical Intensive Care Unit (MICU) patients and hypothesized that elevated uric acid in patients with sepsis is predictive of greater morbidity. The primary end point was the correlation between hyperuricemia and the morbidity rate. Secondary end points were Acute Kidney Injury (AKI), mortality, Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS), and duration of stay. Results. We enrolled 144 patients. 54 (37.5\%) had the primary end point of hyperuricemia. The overall morbidity rate was 85.2\%. The probability of having hyperuricemia along with AKI was 68.5\% and without AKI was 31.5\%. Meanwhile the probability of having a uric acid value {\textless}7 mg/dL along with AKI was 18.9\% and without AKI was 81.1\% (p value {\textless} 0.0001). Conclusion.

	abstract = {A critical step toward developing a successful vaccine to control the human immunodeficiency virus pandemic entails evaluation of vaccine candidates in non-human primates (NHPs). Historically, these studies have usually entailed challenges (i.e., exposures) with very high doses of a simian version of human immunodeficiency virus, resulting in infection of all NHPs in the experiment after a single challenge. More recently, researchers have begun to conduct repeated low-dose challenge (RLC) studies in NHPs that are believed to more closely mimic typical exposure in natural human transmission settings. One objective of RLC studies is to assess whether measured immune responses to vaccination can serve as surrogate endpoints for the primary endpoint of interest, namely infection. In this paper, different designs of RLC studies for assessing a binary surrogate of protection are considered.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Falls from ladders account for a significant number of hospital visits. However, the epidemiology, injury pattern, and how age affects such falls are poorly described in the literature. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Patients {\textgreater}/=18 y who suffered falls from ladders over a 5(1/2)-y period were identified in our trauma registry. Dividing patients into three age groups (18-45, 46-65, and {\textgreater}66 y), we compared demographic characteristics, clinical data, and outcomes including injury pattern and mortality. The odds ratios (ORs) were calculated with the group 18-45 y as reference; group means were compared with one-way analysis of variance. RESULTS: Of 27,155 trauma patients, 340 (1.3\%) had suffered falls from ladders. The average age was 55 y, with a male predominance of 89.3\%. Average fall height was 9.8 ft, and mean Injury Severity Score was 10.6. Increasing age was associated with a decrease in the mean fall height (P {\textless} 0.001), an increase in the mean Injury Severity Score (P {\textless} 0.05), and higher likelihood of admission ({\textgreater}66 y: OR, 5.3; confidence interval [CI], 2.5-11.5). In univariate analysis, patients in the {\textgreater}66-y age group were more likely to sustain traumatic brain injuries (OR, 3.4; CI, 1.5-7.8) and truncal injuries (OR, 3.6; CI, 1.9-7.0) and less likely to sustain hand and/or forearm fractures (OR, 0.3; CI, 0.1-0.9). CONCLUSIONS: Older people are particularly vulnerable after falling from ladders. Although they fell from lower heights, the elderly sustained different and more severe injury patterns. Ladder safety education should be particularly tailored at the elderly.},

Compared with physicians who have completed extensive specialization (eg, fellowships) in pain management, primary care physicians receive much less formal training in managing chronic pain. While chronic pain represents a complicated condition in its own right, the recent increase in opioid prescriptions further muddles treatment. It is unknown whether patients with chronic pain seeking treatment in primary care differ from those seeking treatment in tertiary care settings. This study sought to determine whether patients with chronic pain in primary care reported less pain, fewer psychological variables related to pain, and lower risk of medication misuse/abuse compared with those in tertiary care. METHODS: Data collected from patients with chronic pain in primary care settings and tertiary care settings were analyzed for significant differences using Wilcoxon rank sum tests, Fisher exact tests, and linear regression. A host of variables among populations, including demographics, self-reported pain severity, psychological variables related to pain, and risk for opioid misuse and abuse, were compared. RESULTS: Findings suggest that primary care patients with chronic pain were similar to those in tertiary care on a host of indices and reported more severe pain. There were no significant group differences for risk of medication misuse or abuse. CONCLUSION: It seems that primary care physicians care for a complicated group of patients with chronic pain that rivals the complexity of those seen in specialized tertiary care pain management facilities.},

	abstract = {The mitochondrion has been implicated in the development of diabetic cardiomyopathy. Examination of cardiac mitochondria is complicated by the existence of spatially distinct subpopulations including subsarcolemmal (SSM) and interfibrillar (IFM). Dysfunction to cardiac SSM has been reported in murine models of type 2 diabetes mellitus; however, subpopulation-based mitochondrial analyses have not been explored in type 2 diabetic human heart. The goal of this study was to determine the impact of type 2 diabetes mellitus on cardiac mitochondrial function in the human patient. Mitochondrial subpopulations from atrial appendages of patients with and without type 2 diabetes were examined. Complex I- and fatty acid-mediated mitochondrial respiration rates were decreased in diabetic SSM compared with nondiabetic (P {\textless}/= 0.05 for both), with no change in IFM. Electron transport chain (ETC) complexes I and IV activities were decreased in diabetic SSM compared with nondiabetic (P {\textless}/= 0.05 for both), with a concomitant decline in their levels (P {\textless}/= 0.05 for both). Regression analyses comparing comorbidities determined that diabetes mellitus was the primary factor accounting for mitochondrial dysfunction. Linear spline models examining correlative risk for mitochondrial dysfunction indicated that patients with diabetes display the same degree of state 3 and electron transport chain complex I dysfunction in SSM regardless of the extent of glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) and hyperglycemia. Overall, the results suggest that independent of other pathologies, mitochondrial dysfunction is present in cardiac SSM of patients with type 2 diabetes and the degree of dysfunction is consistent regardless of the extent of elevated HbA1c or blood glucose levels.},

	abstract = {Estimation of treatment effects in randomized studies is often hampered by possible selection bias induced by conditioning on or adjusting for a variable measured post-randomization. One approach to obviate such selection bias is to consider inference about treatment effects within principal strata, that is, principal effects. A challenge with this approach is that without strong assumptions principal effects are not identifiable from the observable data. In settings where such assumptions are dubious, identifiable large sample bounds may be the preferred target of inference. In practice these bounds may be wide and not particularly informative. In this work we consider whether bounds on principal effects can be improved by adjusting for a categorical baseline covariate. Adjusted bounds are considered which are shown to never be wider than the unadjusted bounds. Necessary and sufficient conditions are given for which the adjusted bounds will be sharper (i.e., narrower) than the unadjusted bounds. The methods are illustrated using data from a recent, large study of interventions to prevent mother-to-child transmission of HIV through breastfeeding. Using a baseline covariate indicating low birth weight, the estimated adjusted bounds for the principal effect of interest are 63\% narrower than the estimated unadjusted bounds.},

This study purports to investigate the relationship of ethnicity and CD4+ T cell count attained after stable highly-active antiretroviral treatment (HAART) with glucose metabolism in hyperrtriglyceridemic HIV patients without a history of diabetes. METHODS: Demographic, anthropometric, clinical, endocrinologic, energy expenditure and metabolic measures were obtained in 199 multiethnic, healthy but hypertriglyceridemic HIV- infected patients [46\% Hispanic, 17\% African-American, 37\% Non-Hispanic White (NHW)] on stable HAART without a history of diabetes. The relationship of glucose and insulin responses to ethnicity, CD4 strata (low ({\textless}300/cc) or moderate-to-high ({\textgreater}/= 300/cc)), and their interaction was determined. RESULTS: African-Americans had significantly greater impairment of glucose tolerance (P {\textless} 0.05) and HbA1c levels (P {\textless} .001) than either Hispanics or NHWs. In multivariate models, after adjusting for confounders (age, sex, HIV/HAART duration, smoking, obesity, glucose, insulin and lipids), African-Americans and Hispanics had significantly higher HbA1c and 2-hour glucose levels than NHW's. Demonstrating a significant interaction between ethnicity and CD4 count (P = 0.023), African Americans with CD4 {\textless}300/cc and Hispanics with CD4 {\textgreater}/=300/cc had the most impaired glucose response following oral glucose challenge. CONCLUSIONS: Among hypertriglyceridemic HIV patients on HAART, African- Americans and Hispanics are at increased risk of developing diabetes.

Such comparisons are challenging for two reasons. First, infants are typically randomized at birth (time 0 {\textless} tau(0) ) such that comparisons between trial arms among the subset of infants alive and uninfected at tau(0) are subject to selection bias. Second, in most mother-to-child transmission (MTCT) trials competing risks are often present, such as death or cessation of breastfeeding prior to HIV infection. In this paper, we present methods for assessing the causal effect of a treatment on competing risk outcomes within principal strata. In MTCT trials, the causal effect of interest is that of treatment on the risk of HIV infection by time t {\textgreater} tau(0) within the principal stratum of infants who would be alive and uninfected by tau(0) regardless of randomization assignment. We develop large sample nonparametric bounds and a semiparametric sensitivity analysis model for drawing inference about this causal effect. We present a simulation study demonstrating that the proposed methods perform well in finite samples. We apply the proposed methods to a large, recent MTCT trial.},

	abstract = {PURPOSE: The impact of a rapid peptide nucleic acid fluorescence in situ hybridization (PNA FISH) assay with an antimicrobial stewardship intervention on the treatment of Candida infections was studied. METHODS: The utility of implementing the PNA FISH assay with an antimicrobial stewardship intervention in hospitalized patients with candidemia was evaluated by measuring the median time to Candida species identification, time to targeted therapy, and clinical outcomes, including time to culture clearance, hospital length of stay, and hospital mortality. Secondary objectives included determining the cost-effectiveness of the PNA FISH assay by assessing estimated antifungal drug costs (as average wholesale price) before (June 26, 2009-September 19, 2010) and after (September 20, 2010-June 13, 2011) test implementation and confirming test accuracy. For both groups, laboratory personnel notified the physician of the results of Gram's stain from blood culture. RESULTS: Time to targeted therapy significantly decreased after the implementation of the PNA FISH assay (p = 0.0016). The postimplementation group had a higher rate of culture clearance (p = 0.01). Median time to species identification was 0.2 day with the PNA FISH test versus 4 days with routine methods (p {\textless} 0.001). Accounting for the cost of the test itself and the cases in which patients were switched to more-expensive therapy on the basis of the test, we estimated that the PNA FISH test resulted in savings of approximately \$415 per patient. CONCLUSION: Implementing a PNA FISH test to identify Candida species from yeast-positive blood cultures in conjunction with a pharmacy-driven antimicrobial stewardship protocol decreased the time to targeted antifungal therapy and the time to culture clearance.},

To overcome these limitations, we propose a new mediation methodology for zero-inflated count outcomes using the marginalized zero-inflated Poisson (MZIP) model and the counterfactual approach to mediation. This novel work gives population-average mediation effects whose variance can be estimated rapidly via delta method. This methodology is extended to cases with exposure-mediator interactions. We apply this novel methodology to explore if diabetes diagnosis can explain BMI differences in healthcare utilization and test model performance via simulations comparing the proposed MZIP method to existing zero-inflated and Poisson methods. We find that our proposed method minimizes bias and computation time compared to alternative approaches while allowing for straight-forward interpretations.},

Methods: Pregnant women with HIV at gestational age {\textless}28 weeks were randomized to adjunctive monthly oral AZ 1 g daily or placebo for 3 days and both groups received daily standard oral TMP-SMX through delivery. Primary outcomes were (1) positive peripheral malaria infection by microscopy or polymerase chain reaction and (2) composite bacterial genital STI (Chlamydia trachomatis, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, or syphilis) at delivery. Relative risk and 95\% confidence intervals were estimated using 2 x 2 tables with significance as P {\textless} .05. Results: Pregnant women with HIV (n = 308) were enrolled between March 2018 and August 2020: 155 women were randomized to TMP-SMX-AZ and 153 women to TMP-SMX-placebo. Groups were similar at baseline and loss to follow up was 3.2\%. There was no difference in the proportion with malaria (16.3\% in TMP-SMX-AZ vs 13.2\% in TMP-SMX; relative risk, 1.24 [95\% confidence interval, .71-2.16]) or STI at delivery (4.2\% in TMP-SMX-AZ vs 5.8\% in TMP-SMX; relative risk, 0.72 [95\% confidence interval, .26-2.03]). Adverse birth outcomes were not significantly different, albeit lower in the TMP-SMX-AZ arm (preterm delivery 6.7\% vs 10.7\% [P = .3]; low birthweight 3.4\% vs 5.4\% [P = .6]). Conclusions: The addition of monthly azithromycin to daily TMP-SMX prophylaxis in pregnant women living with HIV in Cameroon did not reduce the risk of malaria or bacterial STI at delivery.},

	abstract = {We integrated safer conception care into a Ugandan HIV clinic. People with HIV (PWH), or partnered with a PWH, and desiring children were eligible for the Healthy Families Clinic Program. Clients completed quarterly safer conception counselling visits and questionnaires to provide information around method preferences and outcomes (partner pregnancy, partner seroconversion). We used clinic level data to evaluate longitudinal viral suppression among PWH. Between November 2016 and January 2020, 361 clients (53\% men) accessed services. 75\% were PWH (51\% women, 96\% men): 99\% were on antiretroviral therapy (ART) and most reported HIV-sero-different partnerships (97\%). Frequently selected safer conception methods included ART (86\%), timed condomless sex (74\%), and PrEP (40\%) with important differences by HIV-serostatus and gender. 22.5\% reported pregnancy. Most (97\%) PWH were virally suppressed at enrolment and 81\% of non-virally suppressed PWH were virally suppressed at 15 months. Two HIV-negative clients (2\%) had HIV seroconversion. There is demand for safer conception care in a public sector HIV-clinic in Uganda. Men and women have unique safer conception care preferences. The majority of clients engaged in safer conception care had viral suppression at follow up.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Newer antiretrivirals (ART) have shifted the metabolic experiences of people with HIV (PWH) from those of wasting syndrome to increases in body mass index (BMI). This study sought to examine the relationship between BMI and ART use among youth with HIV (YWH). METHODS: Charts from YWH ages 10-24 with at least two documented BMIs at least 6 months apart between 2017 and 2020 were included (N = 44). Statistical analyses were conducted in SAS 9.4. RESULTS: Clients were predominately African American (66\%) males (73\%) aged 19-24 years (64\%), with men having sex with men (48\%) being the most common mode of transmission. YWH on non-integrase inhibitor (INSTI) regimens had greater absolute increases in BMI compared to those on INSTI regimens (p = 0.03). Fourteen percent of clients using INSTI experienced an increase in BMI class from normal to overweight or overweight to obese; no non-INSTI users changed BMI class. Time since diagnosis and BMI change due to weight gain were positively associated (p = 0.03) among behaviorally-acquired YWH. CONCLUSIONS: Increasing BMI and changing BMI classes may be more likely among YWH using INSTI. More longitudinal studies inclusive of diet and exercise profiles are needed to understand the relationship between INSTI and YWH BMI.},
